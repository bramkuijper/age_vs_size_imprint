Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The age at which an individual starts to reproduce is a key life-history
 trait with profound fitness consequences

.
 Reproducing early increases the probability of realizing reproduction before
 mortality, while delaying the timing of reproduction allows for the accumulatio
n of more resources, often resulting in a larger fecundity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Blanckenhorn2000"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, a trade-off between juvenile survival and adult fitness arises,
 suggesting that selection favors an optimal age of sexual maturation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stearns1992,Roff2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 However, age at sexual maturition has been shown to have a complicated
 genetic architecture, commonly involving not only genes expressed by the
 offspring itself, but also by genes expressed in the parent or grandparents
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hafer2011,Saastamoinen2013,Kruuk2015"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, recent studies find that age at maturity is also affected by
 genomic imprinting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Charalambous2007,Perry2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, thus involving differential expression of alleles dependent on their parent
 of origin 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ferguson-Smith2011,Koehler2012"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This raises the question when and where genomic imprinting is expected
 to underly the timing of sexual maturation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although recent theoretical studies have started to assess in which ecological
 and social contexts genomic imprinting is likely to evolve 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "reviewed in"
key "Holman2014,Patten2014,Spencer2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, most of these studies focus on an abstract phenotype which only affects
 offspring survival [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g.,"

\end_inset

 but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Wild2009,Farrell2015,VanCleve2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

], thus ignoring most of the constraints and trade-offs underlying life-history
 traits in reality.
 Here we therefore assess the evolution of genomic imprinting in a realistic
 life-history model on the evolution of age and size at sexual maturation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Roff1984,Roff2002,Johnstone2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, where faster maturation increases the probability of surviving to maturity
 at the cost of a smaller adult size and thus lower fecundity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We study the evolution of genomic imprinting on age versus size at maturity
 in a structured population, taking a demographically explicit approach
 where local competition and relatedness arise from limited dispersal 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rousset2004,Lion2011,Gardner2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Studying a demographical model of age versus size at maturity is essential
 for two key reasons: first, local competition among relatives has been
 repeatedly shown to affect various life-history traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pen2000,Ronce2004,Ronce2010,Lion2010a,Kuijper2015a"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, as it changes the trade-off between current and future reproduction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pen2000"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, in a recent demographical model of age at sexual maturation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnstone2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we showed that the sex which experiences more local competition has an
 accelerated rate of sexual maturity.
 Second, relatedness asymmetries due to sex-biased dispersal and/or mating
 skew are well-known to favor the evolution of genomic imprinting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Haig2000a,Brandvain2010,Brandvain2011,VanCleve2010,Ubeda2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is because sex-biased dispersal leads to asymmetries in relatedness
 between maternally versus paternally inherited alleles and their relatives,
 so that differential gene expression is likely to evolve when the trait
 in question affects interactions between relatives 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Haig2000a"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, whether genomic imprinting affects age at sexual maturity
 is likely to be strongly dependent on the degree of local competition and
 sex differences in dispersal and/or mating skew.

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach is to develop an evolutionary demographic model

 of the evolution of genomic imprinting on age at sexual maturation.
 Consider a population distributed over infinitely many territories 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wright1931,Wright1951"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, in which individuals reproduce sexually and generations are nonoverlapping.
 Each territory contains 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{f}}$
\end_inset

 adult female breeders and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{m}}$
\end_inset

 adult male breeders.
 Territories are linked by juvenile dispersal, so that newborn females (or
 males) disperse to random territory with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

) and remain on their natal patch with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathrm{f}}=1-d_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathrm{m}}=1-d_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to seminal models (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Roff1984,Stearns1986"
literal "true"

\end_inset

), we assume that there is a trade-off between survival as an offspring
 and reproductive success as an adult, mediated by age at maturity, which
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 in females and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 in males.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Say why we consider sex-limited expression of age at maturity
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Although qualitatively similar, the trade-off takes a slightly different
 form dependent on the sex considered: in adult females, age at maturity
 directly affects the number of offspring produced, while in adult males
 age at maturity determines his fertilization success relative to other
 males.
 Consequently, females provide all investment in offspring, while males
 compete for paternity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will write 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a)$
\end_inset

 for a female's fecundity or a male's relative success in competition for
 paternity, where we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a)$
\end_inset

 increases deceleratingly with 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 At the start of each generation, a focal female of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{f}}^{i}$
\end_inset

 then produces a large number of offspring (in a 1:1 sex ratio) proportional
 to her fecundity 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{i})$
\end_inset

, while the average fecundity in the local patch is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

.
 A focal male's share of fertilizations of all locally born young is then
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}/n_{\mathrm{m}}\times f(a_{\mathrm{m}}^{i})/f(a_{\mathrm{m}})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}/n_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 reflects the average number of matings achieved by a single male, while
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{m}}^{i})/f(a_{\mathrm{m}})$
\end_inset

 reflects his fertilization success relative to the average fertilization
 success by all males in the local patch.
 Upon birth, female and male offspring survive with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{m}})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 strictly decreases with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

.
 Female and male offspring who survive to maturity then disperse with respective
 probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

, after which native and immigrant female and male offspring on each patch
 compete for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 breeding positions vacated by the death of the previous generation.
 Offspring who fail to claim a breeding position die, after which the life
 cycle repeats itself.

Results

\begin_layout Subsection
Result 1: age at maturity increases with philopatry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix ideas, we first consider a scenario in which individuals express
 their own phenotype, in the absence of imprinting or parental effects.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ES_nf2_nm2"

\end_inset

 then shows how sex-biased dispersal influences optimal age at maturity
 in females (panels A, C) and males (panels B, D) for different probabilities
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 with which males exlusively mate within their their local group.
 Importantly, when males mate only locally 
\begin_inset Formula $(\ell=1)$
\end_inset

, we find that sex-differences in dispersal only affects age at maturity
 in females but not males: specifically, female age at maturity increases
 with rising levels of female philopatry (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ES_nf2_nm2"

\end_inset

A), whereas male age at maturity is unaffected by dispersal (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ES_nf2_nm2"

\end_inset

B).
 By contrast, when males mate nonlocally, we find a qualitatively similar
 pattern in both sexes: age at maturity increases with the probability of
 philopatry of that sex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we find these patterns? Regarding female age maturity, consider a
 case where females are more philopatric than males.
 In this case, any increase in female fecundity 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 (through a delayed female age at maturity) will increase the number of
 philopatric daughters competing in the local patch.
 At the same time however, increased 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 also results in a larger number of dispersing sons, who will be likely
 to compete with unrelated males in a remote patch.
 By contrast, any increases in female juvenile survival 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 only increases local competition among juvenile females, with no concomitant
 effect on male relatives.
 Consequently, the prospect of producing dispersing sons leads females to
 value fecundity more strongly than survival, favoring an increased female
 age at maturity with increasing female philopatry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding male age at maturity, consider a scenario where males are dispersing
 sex: any increase in male fertility 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{m}})$
\end_inset

 (through a later male age at maturity) increases local competition for
 sirings among adult males (rather than among young).
 Similarly, any increase in male juvenile survival 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{m}})$
\end_inset

 also increases competition among male juvenile relatives.
 Indeed, it can be shown that male philopatry increases local competition
 among juvenile males and adult males at exactly the same rate.
 Consequently, we recover the classical result by Taylor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Taylor1992"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that limited dispersal has no effect on social interactionsw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
 In the presence of nonlocal mating, however, adult males are now more likely
 to compete for fertilizations with unrelated males, causing males to value
 fertility more strongly than survival and favoring an increased male age
 at maturity with increasing male philopatry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A previous study which considered equal dispersal rates across the sexes
 showed that limited dispersal favors a lower female age at maturity, yet
 a higher male age at maturity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnstone2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, at least when there is a slight degree of nonlocal mating 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell<1$
\end_inset

.
 The same pattern is found in the current study for males, yet not for females:
 to recapatulate the result for males from the previous study, in viscous
 populations with a slight degree of nonlocal mating, an increase in male
 fecundity results in more sirings in remote patches, whereas an increase
 in male juvenile survival leads to more competition among males in the
 local patch, favoring a higher male age at maturity.
 The same pattern, although for slightly different reasons, is found here:
 an increase in male age at maturity leads to a higher fertily (both in
 remote 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, things are different when the sexes differ in dispersal, as limited
 dispersal by one sex always selects for an increase in the age at maturity
 of that sex.
 Why is this the case? When females are the more philopatric sex, an increase
 in a female's age at maturity (and hence an increase in fecundity) now
 leads to less kin competition overall: although more daughters are produced
 who will compete with each other, also more sons are produced, who disperse
 and compete for breeding positions elsewhere.
 By contrast, an increase in a female's juvenile survival increases competition
 among philopatric female relatives, yet has no effect on dispersing males.
 Hence, in the presence of sex-differences in dispersal, we would predict
 that the more philopatric sex has the highest age at maturity.

Consequently, whether dispersal is the same or different across the sexes

Regarding the first line, an adult female bearing the focal allele has fecundity
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{i})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 of which are daughters.
 The transmission coefficient

\end_inset

 reflects the probability that an allele in offspring of sex 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 is inherited from a parent of sex 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 In diploids, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ij}=1/2$

 In haplodiploids, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mathrm{ff}}=1/2,\ t_{\mathrm{fm}}=1,\ t_{\mathrm{fm}}=1/2,t_{\mathrm{mm}}=0$
\end_inset

 The first part within brackets reflect the proportion of daughters who
 remain in the natal patch (with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-d_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

) and successfully survive with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{j}i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{j}i}$
\end_inset

 reflects the phenotype of the focal allele in juveniles.
 These philopatric daughters compete for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 breeding positions with all 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}f(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{ff}})(1-d_{\mathrm{f}})s(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{jff}})$

 surviving philopatric female juveniles and all 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}f(a_{\mathrm{f}})d_{\mathrm{f}}s(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 surviving immigrant female juveniles.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{ff}})$
\end_inset

 reflects the fecundity averaged over all adult females in the local patch
 when the focal allele copy is borne by an adult female, while 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 reflects the average fecundity of adult females in the rest of the population.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{jff}})$
\end_inset

 reflects the average survival of all female juveniles produced in the local
 patch when the focal allele copy is borne by an adult female and the survival
 
\begin_inset Formula $s(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 of female juveniles in the rest of the population.
 Alternatively, with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{f}}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-d_{\mathrm{f}}+d_{\mathrm{f}})f(a_{\mathrm{f}})s(a_{\mathrm{f}})$
\end_inset

 surviving female juveniles for breeding positions.
 The other equations can be derived in a similar fashion.
 When considering the number 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\cdot\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 of successfully established offspring born from a focal adult male, note
 that he can compete for matings in the local patch with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

, while he mates in a random remote patch with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\ell$

 In both cases, his average mating success is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{f}}f(a_{\mathrm{m}})/(n_{\mathrm{m}}f(a_{\mathrm{m}}))$
\end_inset

, and the number of offspring he sires is given by the average fecundity
 of the female breeders in that patch (
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{\mathrm{f}}^{\mathrm{fm}})$

 in the local patch, indicating female fecundity when the focal allele copy
 is present in a male) or

Regarding the third line, we need the probability of identity between the
 focal adult male and a male in the previous generation, who fathered the
 randomly chosen female.
 This is the probability of identity between the focal male's mother and
 a locally mating male in the same generation, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\hat{Q}_{\mathrm{mf}}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, relatedness between an adult focal male and another male is given
 by the default probability of identity between adult males (see offspring
 expression in eq.
 [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula

Calculation is again straightforward: note again that paternal effects are
 assumed absent in haploid males, so in these cases, relatedness is given
 by default coefficients of relatedness without paternal effects (see offspring
 expression).
